# ðŸ’« About Us:
The Center for Personalized Diagnostics (CPD) is a joint initiative between Penn Medicine's Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the Abramson Cancer Center to support precision medicine at Penn.

The CPD aims to uncover genetic mutations within a patient's own cancer that can allow for a more targeted and personalized "precision" treatment strategy.

By integrating Molecular Genetics, Pathology Informatics, and Genomic Pathology for precision-medicine diagnoses, the CPD can help physicians provide an appropriate and individualized treatment plan for their patients.

Precision genomic diagnostics can identify patients who might benefit from current, often cutting-edge therapies, while sparing those who do not have a particular genetic signature from the costs and side effects of certain treatments.

Most importantly perhaps, precision medicine can significantly reduce the time conventional diagnostic approaches require, allowing patients and their loved ones to make informed decisions â€“ when time matters most.
